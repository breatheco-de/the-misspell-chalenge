<!-- endhide -->

Engaging in public learning involves teamwork, and expertise isn't a prerequisite for collaboration. Misspellings present an opportunity! They serve as a friendly introduction to contributing to open-source projects; correcting a misspelling is simple and doesn't demand extensive GitHub or Git knowledge.
