# The Misspell Challenge
<!-- endhide -->
Learning in public means collaboration, and you don't have to be an expert to collaborate. Misspells come to the rescue!

The perfect ice-breaker for open-source contributions; fixing a misspell is easy and requires almost no GitHub or git expertise.

## 📝 Instructions

Find one misspell on any of the lessons, projects or exercises and create a pull request with the fix.

> Important: Please find another project to fix, this project has already been fixed enough 😂
