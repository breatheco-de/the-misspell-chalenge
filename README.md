# The Misspell Challenge
<!-- endhide -->
Learning in public means collaboration, and you don't have to be an expert to collaborate. Misspells come to the rescue! The perfect ice-breaker for open-source contributions; fixing a misspell is easy and requires almost no GitHub or Git experience.

## 🔷 How to fix a misspell on a 4Geeks Lesson:  

![edit on Github](https://github.com/breatheco-de/the-misspell-chalenge/blob/master/assets/github-logo2.png?raw=true)

1. Click the pencil icon that says "Edit on GitHub" at the top right of the lesson, and the lesson source file will be editable. 

2. Correct the misspelling of the lesson or add information that is relevant to the project you are updating

3. Finally, click on `"Pull Request"`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Find one misspell on any of the 4Geeks lessons, projects or exercises and create a `pull request` with the fix.

> **IMPORTANT**: Please find another project to fix, this project has already been fixed enough 😂
