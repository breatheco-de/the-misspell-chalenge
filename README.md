# The Misspell Challenge
<!-- endhide -->
Learning in public means collaborating, and you don't need to be an expert to collaborate - misspellings come to the rescue! The perfect icebreaker for open source contributions, fixing a misspelling is easy and requires almost no experience on GitHub or Git.
